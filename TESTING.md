# Testing

For testing purposes there is a file `pages.xml` that can be loaded by calling `composer import`
in the Pickle root directory, or by using `Special:Import`. It might be necessary to give yourself
additional righs to do that, but in a default Vagrant setup "Admin will have the necessary rights.

The page `PAGELIST` holds the pages to be exported, and to do the actual export and rebuild the file
`pages.xml`, call `composer import`, in the Pickle root directory. It is also possible to do the same
by manually copy-pasting `PAGELIST` into `Special:Import`. In this case you must change the name of
the exported file if you want to reimport it with `composer import`.

After importing the pages, the "Main Page" should give you a few additional links, one going to a
page of test cases. This page links to predefined test cases for various purposes, especially to
verify proper integration of the various parts. They are also working examples on how you can
interact with the framework.
